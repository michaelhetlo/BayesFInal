play_by_play_2 <- play_by_play %>%
  filter(!is.na(yards_gained), home_team == posteam) %>%
  group_by(game_id, home_team) %>%
  mutate(year = year(game_date))%>%
  select(year, game_id, home_team, yards_gained)%>%
  summarize(total_yds = sum(yards_gained))
  
play_by_play_2 %>%
  group_by(home_team, ) %>%
  summarize(yds_per_gm = mean(total_yds))

```

To start let us explore some basic 

```{r}
play_by_play %>%
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = )
```
